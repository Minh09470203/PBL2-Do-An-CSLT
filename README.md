- **MyMap<K,V>**: Binary search tree implementation similar to std::map

### File Format

All data is stored in pipe-delimited text files:

```
Data/
â”œâ”€â”€ Accounts.txt     # User accounts (username|password|type|userID)
â”œâ”€â”€ Customer.txt     # Customer information
â”œâ”€â”€ Staff.txt        # Staff information  
â”œâ”€â”€ Product.txt      # Product catalog
